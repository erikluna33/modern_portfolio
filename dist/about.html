               <p>I'm a promising and passionate software developer who is continuously learning
               and growing. Over the past two years, I have gained experience by attending a bootcamp and by working on various full stack applications. I have learned the importance of writing highly readable and easily maintainable code, of collaborating with team members, and of creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces. My long-term professional goal is to join my passion for Speech Pathology with my software engineering skills to improve accessibility within healthcare technology. As an opportunist, I truly value problem-solving, creativity, and community. I constantly strive to learn new technologies and continually improve as a developer in this ever- changing industry.</p>
